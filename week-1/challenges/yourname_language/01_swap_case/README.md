# Challenge 01: Swap Case

## Problem Description
You are given a string, and your task is to swap the case of each character in the string. In other words, convert all lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.

### Example
Input: `HackerRank.com presents "Pythonist 2"`
Output: `hACKERrANK.COM PRESENTS "pYTHONIST 2"`

## Hints
- Understand how to traverse a string in Python.
- Learn about string methods like `.isupper()`, `.islower()`, and `.swapcase()`.
- Consider edge cases such as numbers, special characters, and empty strings.

## Next Level Challenge
Try to solve this problem without relying on built-in functions such as `.isupper()`, `.islower()`, or `.swapcase()`.

### Additional Hints
1. Research how to identify if a letter is uppercase or lowercase using ASCII values.
2. Understand how the ASCII table works and how to manipulate character cases using arithmetic operations.

### Additional Constraint
- Aim to solve the problem with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. Avoid using additional libraries or built-in methods.
