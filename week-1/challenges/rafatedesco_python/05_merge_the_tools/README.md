# Challenge 05: Merge the Tools

## Problem Description
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, divide the string into `n/k` substrings (where `n` is the length of the string). For each substring, remove any duplicate characters while maintaining the order of characters.

### Example
Input:
```
String: AABCAAADA
Integer: 3
```
Output:
```
AB
CA
AD
```

## Hints
- Learn about string slicing and how to divide a string into equal parts.
- Understand how to use a set to track unique characters.
- Explore Python's string manipulation techniques to maintain character order.

## Next Level Challenge
Try to solve this problem without using Python's built-in set or slicing methods.

### Additional Hints
1. Research how to manually track unique characters in a substring.
2. Understand how to divide the string into equal parts without slicing.

### Additional Constraint
- Aim to solve the problem with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.
