# Challenge 04: Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Problem Description
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

### Example
Input: `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`
Output: `4`
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

## Hints
- Learn about hash sets and how they can be used for quick lookups.
- Understand how to iterate through an array and check for consecutive sequences.
- Explore edge cases like empty arrays or arrays with one element.

## Next Level Challenge
Try to solve this problem without using a hash set or dictionary for lookups.

### Additional Hints
1. Research how to sort the array and find consecutive sequences manually.
2. Understand how to optimize the solution to avoid nested loops.

### Additional Constraint
- Aim to solve the problem with a time complexity better than O(n^2).
