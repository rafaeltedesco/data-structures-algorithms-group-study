# Challenge 03: Symmetric Difference

## Problem Description
Given two sets of integers, your task is to compute their symmetric difference. The symmetric difference is defined as the set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.

### Example
Input:
```
Set A: {2, 4, 5, 9}
Set B: {2, 4, 11, 12}
```
Output:
```
5
9
11
12
```

## Hints
- Understand the concept of sets and their operations like `.union()`, `.intersection()`, and `.difference()`.
- Learn how to sort a set in ascending order.
- Explore Python's built-in `set` data structure and its methods.

## Next Level Challenge
Try to solve this problem without using Python's built-in set operations like `.union()`, `.intersection()`, or `.difference()`.

### Additional Hints
1. Research how to manually compute the symmetric difference using loops.
2. Understand how to handle duplicate elements and maintain order.

### Additional Constraint
- Aim to solve the problem with a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the sizes of the two sets.
