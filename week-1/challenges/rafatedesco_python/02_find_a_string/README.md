# Challenge 02: Find a String

## Problem Description
In this challenge, you are given a string and a substring. Your task is to count the number of times the substring occurs in the given string. String traversal will take place from left to right.

### Example
Input:
```
String: ABCDCDC
Substring: CDC
```
Output: `2`

## Hints
- Learn about string slicing and how to traverse a string using loops.
- Understand the concept of overlapping substrings.
- Explore Python's built-in string methods like `.find()` and `.count()`.

## Next Level Challenge
Try to solve this problem without using Python's built-in `.find()` or `.count()` methods.

### Additional Hints
1. Research how to manually traverse a string to find substrings.
2. Understand how to handle overlapping substrings without built-in methods.

### Additional Constraint
- Aim to solve the problem with a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the substring.
